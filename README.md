# Contact Form Package for Meteor
This is an easy to use, drop-in package for Meteor that allows you to have a very basic contact form ready-to-go.

## Usage
Add the package with:  
```
meteor add rgoomar:contactform
```

Make an empty template that your router will point to and include this:
```
{{> contactForm }}
```

### Note:
This is still under development. If you have any suggestions, please make an issue for discussion.
